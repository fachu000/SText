% SET FOLLOWING VARIABLE TO 1 FOR EDIT MODE AND 0 FOR VIEW MODE
% (erase .bbl and .aux files in this folder every time
% you switch from one mode to another, otherwise you get
% an error)  
% One of the features of the edit mode is that it shows citations in
% boldface if they are not defined in the bibtex file, like the [?] in
% view mode. Different from the view mode, the edit mode indicates
% which is the missing reference.
%
% Also, when writing the response letter, you may need to set this
% variable to 0 in order for cross-referencing to work.
\def\editmode{0}

% The following variable needs to be set to 0 to compile the response letter.
% Else, cross-referencing will not work (xcite is incompatible with href).
\def\hyperlinks{0} 

% Wether to use the format of the IEEE SPS:
\def\spsformat{0}

% Wether to use a single column with the same width as the columns in the
% double-column format. This is useful for editing and reviewing the
% document in a laptop screen. 
\def\singlenarrowcol{0} % only applicable if spsformat == 0

% set the following variable to the filenames, separated by commas, of
% the bibfiles that contain your references.  
\def\bibfilenames{bibman_refs}

% If \journal == 0, only the conference content is shown. 
% If \journal == 1, only the journal content is shown.
% If \journal == 2, both the conference and journal content are shown. The journal content is shown in dark yellow (as old newspapers), the conference content in blue/green (as the sea). 
\def\journal{2}

% If 0, intermediate steps are not shown. 
% If 1, intermediate steps are shown in purple
% Note that one cannot have "\\" inside an "intermed" environment. Just put `\jumpline` before or after the environment instead of "\\".  The same for "&" and "\alignchar"
\def\intermediatesteps{1}

% Consider using the following package to equalize the length of the columns of
% the last page of the document. 
% \usepackage{flushend}

% Use the following lines if you want to modify how citations are displayed
%% \let\oldcite\cite
%% \renewcommand{\cite}[1]{\textbf{\oldcite{#1}}}

\begin{abstract}
    Toggle the LaTeX variable \texttt{editmode} in the main source file to
    show/hide the bullets and labels. If switching the edit mode results
    in a compilation error, just delete the .aux file.

    If the LaTeX variable \texttt{singlenarrowcol} is 1, then each page contains
    a single column whose size equals the size of each of the columns in a
    double-column layout. This is convenient for editing and reviewing the
    document in a laptop screen. The number of pages when
    \texttt{singlenarrowcol} is 1 is roughly twice the number of pages when
    \texttt{singlenarrowcol} is 0.

    \blt[motivation]
    \blt[literature] [test citation~\cite{kay1}]
    \blt[contributions]
    \blt[paper structure]Sec.~\ref{sec:model} introduces the system model and formulates the problem\ldots
    \blt[notation]
\end{bullets}

\section{Model and Problem Formulation}
\label{sec:model}

\begin{bullets}
    \blt[model]    The following equation illustrates the usage of \texttt{salign}, \texttt{\textbackslash hc} and \texttt{\textbackslash{}newcommandoa}:
    \begin{salign}[eq:globallabel]
        \label{eq:testequation}
        \testsymbol&=1\\
        \sectestsymbol &\in \{\sectestsymbol[0],\ldots,\sectestsymbol[N-1]\}
    \end{salign}

    \blt[problem formulation]For an enumeration that should be visible when not in edit mode, use \texttt{\textbackslash cmt}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \cmt{first item} This goes first.
        \item \cmt{second item} This goes second.
    \end{enumerate}


\end{bullets}

\section{Proposed Solution}
\begin{bullets}%
    \blt[intermed] Intermediate steps are shown in purple if \texttt{\textbackslash intermediatesteps} is set to 1.
    \begin{align}
        (x+1)^2 + (x-1)^2
        \alignchar
        \begin{intermed}
            = x^2 + 2x + 1 + x^2 - 2x + 1
        \end{intermed}
        \jlac= 2x^2 + 2
    \end{align}
    Use \texttt{\textbackslash jumpline} instead of \texttt{\textbackslash\textbackslash} and  \texttt{\textbackslash alignchar} instead of \texttt{\&}. A short form for \texttt{\textbackslash jumpline\textbackslash alignchar} is \texttt{\textbackslash jlac}.
\end{bullets}%


\section{Analysis}

\begin{bullets}
    \blt[overview]
    \blt[journal]  Set the variable \texttt{journal} to 0, 1, or 2 to show only the conference content, only the journal content, or both in different colors, respectively.
    \begin{journalonly}
        This is the journal-only content.
    \end{journalonly}
    \begin{conferenceonly}
        This is the conference-only content.
    \end{conferenceonly}

    \blt[References]Use \texttt{\textbackslash label\{prop:XXXX\}} to label any proposition, which includes theorems, lemmas, and corollaries. To refer to it, use \texttt{\textbackslash Cref\{prop:XXXX\}}. Replace \texttt{XXXX} with the label of the proposition.  For example, next result is~\Cref{prop:mainresult}.

    \blt[main result]

    \begin{theorem}
        \label{prop:mainresult}
        If it rains, it is cloudy.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{IEEEproof}
        \begin{conferenceonly}
            The proof is omitted due to lack of space.
        \end{conferenceonly}
        \begin{journalonly}
            The proof is in Appendix~\ref{app:proof}.
        \end{journalonly}
    \end{IEEEproof}

    \blt[corollary] Now a consequence of \Cref{prop:mainresult}:

    \begin{corollary}
        \label{prop:corollary}
        If it rains, it is cloudy.
    \end{corollary}

    We refer to it as \Cref{prop:corollary}.
